# RadioLabDownloader

 Download tool for the RadioLab podcast.
 
 This tool will download all episodes of the RadioLab podcast starting with "Where Am I?" from 2006.
 If you use this tool please consider [donating to RadioLab](https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab/onestep/?ref=download-tool)
 as the total number of shows is over 11Gb in size, which is an unusually large hit for their server (and the show is just super cool).
 
 ## Download
 See the [Release](https://github.com/RandomEskimo/RadioLabDownloader/releases) section to download for Windows 10 or Mac.
 
 ## Instructions
 Just run the tool ("RadioLabDownloader.exe" for Win 10 or "RadioLabDownloader" for OSX). It will show that it 
 is counting the episodes, which should take less than a minute. Next it will show that it is building the episode list,
 this will also take some time but will show the progress in percent (This will only take a long time the first time).
 After this the tool will start downloading episodes starting with the oldest first. It will show "failed" in red for 
 any episodes that aren't able to be downloaded. 
 
 The downloaded episodes will be placed into a folder called "Episodes".
 
 The tool may take a few hours to run depending on the speed of your connection and the load on the 
 RadioLab server. If you need to stop downloading and resume later then simply close the tool. It will
 not re-download episodes. When RadioLab releases new episodes you can simply run the tool to download 
 the new episodes.

 ### Note
 For some reason the tool is unable to download three episodes
 * Speedy Beat
 * The Man Behind The Maneuver
 * REBROADCAST: Emergence
 This is most likely an issue on the server end. Maybe the files are missing?
